## HOW TO GET A CS UNDERGRAD JOB

You're an undergraduate who wants a job in the software industry. I am here to help you.

Why? Because when I was in your shoes, I was totally clueless, and it sucked. Frankly, if I hadn't gotten _significant_ early guidance from upperclassmen, I would be unemployed. This is my way of passing it on.

I don't pretend to know anything, so please triangulate anything I say with individuals of superior judgement. Defer to the experts. I'm still writing this, though, because I managed to (partly) make it through the game:
- as of Spring 2021, I'm a Columbia University CS major finishing up my final year
- during college, I interned at four companies of wildly different sizes and sectors
- I'll be going to work at a FAANG company after graduation

Anyways, here are the most actionable pieces of advice I could come up with!

not connections; friends, partners

interviewing

negotiating
